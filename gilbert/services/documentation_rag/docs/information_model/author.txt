# Author

Fields relating to the author of a document.

If the field has an alias, it is written in **bold**.  Corresponding Gyda field names are written in *italics*.

If the field has two names than it means that the SAME information is stored in both fields for some documents, if that is the case we recommend you to use the mainAuthor.* fields if your use case allows it (see more below).

### Main Author vs the Author array

Note that we currently have two ways to model authors in some of our documents.

One set of fields are put under the *metaData.authors* namespace,  which models an array of Author objects.
The *metaData.authors* fields are [nested](../terminology.md)   fields and need to use the [nested query types](/docs/default/api/search-api-v1/queries/special-queries/#nested-query) and the *nestedPath* parameter when performing analytics on those fields.  Analytics on these nested author fields are also a lot more *resource intensive* than top level fields.

The *metaData.mainAuthor* fields on the other hand, are *top level fields* and do not need any nested wrapping when being used in search requests.

Our recommendation if you have a choice is to **always use the fields** whose name is starting with **metaData.mainAuthor** if you can.
