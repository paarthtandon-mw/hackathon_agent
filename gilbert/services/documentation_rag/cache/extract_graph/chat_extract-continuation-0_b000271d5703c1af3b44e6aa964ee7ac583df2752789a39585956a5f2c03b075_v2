It's a low-latency synchronous API where you execute requests and receive analytics and matches.\n\nTo request acces to this API, please follow the instructions for [Creating a Content API Consumer](docs/default/domain/information-retrieval/api-access/consumers/), and specify `v2-search` as the API.\n\n## Search API V2 Features\n\nThis API delivers legally compliant search content. It builds on the existing functionality of Search API V1, but with some augmentations to the request language.\n\nIt aims to replicate the full functionality of the Search API V1 but also provide some helpful enhancements to translate the media intelligence domain of companies and saved searches into runes queries and legally compliant results.\n\nAlready familiar with the [Search API V1](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/)? Check our [Migrating from Search API V1](v2-search-migrating-from-v1.md) to see what's different in the Search API V2.\n\nSome areas the Search API V2 can help are:\n\n#### Small synchronous search queries\n\nThe Search API V2 works well for small amounts of data (ideally less than 1000 results). It is not designed of large result sets. The [Export API V2](/docs/default/API/export-api-v2) works well for exporting large amounts of search results. See the [Search Use Cases Guide](/docs/default/domain/information-retrieval/api_access/search-use-cases/) to help determine what the right API is for your use case.\n\n#### Showing documents to an end-user\n\nDocuments that we show to an end-user have to undergo scrutiny to make sure they adhere to Meltwaters agreements with content providers. Some documents may need to be redacted due to geographical restrictions, others may need to be reported as viewed by an end-user. By default, all content returned by this API is legally compliant.\n\n#### Media Intelligence enhancements\n\nThe Search API V2 provides some enhancements specific to the Media Intelligence domain. It supports [Saved Search Query Types](v2-saved-search-query-type.md), [Custom Category Query Types](v2-custom-category-query-type.md), [Keyword Query Types](v2-keyword-query-type.md), different [Document formats](v2-document-formats.md) and other enhancements such as paywall Urls in search results.\n\n#### Reporting compliance\n\nMeltwater has contractual agreements with many different content providers. For each content provider we have different requirements on reporting — for some we report each document consumed both for internal and external use, for others, we only report documents consumed by external users.\n\nThis API is fully compliant with Meltwater's reporting requirements, ensuring all documents consumed are reported to their corresponding content providers in a compliant manner.\n\n\n## 1. The anatomy of search requests\n\nA search request consists of a Boolean query and a number of different view requests to execute over the matched documents.\n\nThe search query parameter express the Boolean conditions that documents must match, for example the search terms to find. It must contain a time range filter that restricts the publish time of documents to match.\n\nThe view requests express one or more aggregations and result lists that should be calculated from the matched documents. View requests are typically a mix of multiple aggregations, nested aggregations and result lists.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **query**: The filter to match documents against, see [Queries](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/) and [Fields](/docs/default/Component/mi-information-model/Dataset/search-fields/).\n- **viewRequests**: The aggregations and result lists to calculate, see [Analytics](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/analytics/statistics/) and [Results](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/results/retrieving-hits/).\n- **modifiers**: This contains attributes that are required to perform legal compliance restrictions and reporting e. g. `requestorCompanyId`. For details of all modifier parameters, take a look at the [Request Modifiers](v2-request-modifiers.md) page.\n- **scope** (*optional*): Scope allows searching on specific document states, see [Scopes](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/advanced-usage/overlays/#scopes).\n- **metaData** (*optional*): Used to help identify requests. Search API V2 only accepts `metaData.savedSearchIds`, a list of search IDs that the search request is based upon\n\n\n```json\n// Searching for \"meltwater\" in the document title and executing 2 views\n// - Counting total matches\n// - Retrieving a sample of search results\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"type\": \"all\",\n    \"allQueries\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"word\",\n        \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n        \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"range\",\n        \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"from\": 1546300800000,\n        \"to\": 1546905599999\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"documentCount\": {\n      \"type\": \"count\"\n    },\n    \"searchResults\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\",\n      \"start\": 0,\n      \"size\": 2,\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"body.title.text\",\n        \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"metaData.url\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"modifiers\": {\n    \"requestorCompanyId\": \"59103b0662eb71f944d99b05\",\n    \"requestorUserId\": \"59103b0762eb71f944d99b06\",\n    \"productType\": \"swagger\"\n  },   \n  \"metaData\": {\n    \"savedSearchIds\":\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MELTWATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meltwater is a company that provides media intelligence and analytics services, including the Search API V2 which allows users to execute Boolean queries and retrieve aggregated analytics and result lists)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>EVENT<|>Search API V2 is a service provided by Meltwater that offers enhanced search capabilities, including legally compliant search content and media intelligence enhancements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEARCH API V1<|>EVENT<|>Search API V1 is the predecessor to Search API V2, providing foundational search functionalities that the latter builds upon)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELTWATER<|>SEARCH API V2<|>Meltwater provides the Search API V2 as part of its media intelligence services<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>SEARCH API V1<|>Search API V2 builds on the existing functionality of Search API V1 with additional enhancements<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
