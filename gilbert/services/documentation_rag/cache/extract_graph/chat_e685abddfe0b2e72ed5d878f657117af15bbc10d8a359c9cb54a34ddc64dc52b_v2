This field uses feature [#416](https://github.com/meltwater/platform-tenants/pull/416) to store the embedding vector in base64. The field cannot be matched but using `exists` queries allows to filter documents having an image embedding computed. \n\n## Embeddings\nFields containing embedding vectors that can be used for knn searches and potentially other vector operations.\nThe field name of the embedding should preferably contain a unique identifier of the embedding model that was used to\nproduce the dense vectors stored in the field.\n\nEmbedding fields of dense_vector type will not be retrievable from the index, i.e. you can't get the vectors back from elasticsearch, you can only search on them. \n\n**NOTE** _At the moment embedding fields are NOT stored or indexed in the main elasticsearch v7 cluster._ If you would like to add an embedding field to the information model, please contact Team Horace for guidance and help.\n\n| Field Name                                           | Description                                                                                                                                   | Filter Type | Field Type   | Owner  |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------|\n| enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.vector | Field that contains dense vectors produced by Clippy.

The attachments are stored as a list of objects.\n\n| Field Name                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Filter Type                 | Field Type | Owner         |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |\n| attachments.link<br><br>_images[].link_         | URL of attachment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | _Not supported in queries._ | String     | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.thumbnail                           | URL of thumbnail image (if applicable)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | _Not supported in queries._ | String     | Core Platform |\n| attachments.width                               | to be added                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | _Not supported in queries._ | Integer    | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.source                              | to be added                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | _Not supported in queries._ | String     | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.secureLink                          | to be added                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | _Not supported in queries._ | String     | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.height                              | to be added                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | _Not supported in queries._ | Integer    | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.description                         | Description of attachment. <br>For example alternate text for image attachments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | _Not supported in queries._ | String     | Shakespeare   |\n| attachments.data                                | The attachment itself.
