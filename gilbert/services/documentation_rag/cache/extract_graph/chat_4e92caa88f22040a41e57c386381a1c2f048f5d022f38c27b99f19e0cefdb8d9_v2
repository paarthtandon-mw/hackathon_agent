It validates the correctness and predicted resource usage of all queries before executing them, and enforces rate and credit limits per API consumer. \n\nThere's no need to pre-validate requests for the search systems sake, but you may still want to do that to avoid the case where a single one of your users are allowed to exhaust your credit limit by submitting a very expensive search. For example you may want to only allow searches to be used in your application if they're well within your per-second credit limit. \n\nYou can use the [/search/validate endpoint](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/api-post-search-validate/) to validate and calculate the cost for a request without executing it. See [Rate Limits](search-limits.md) for a discussion on how to monitor your rate and credit limits.\n\n## Validation Flow\n\nThe validation is done on several levels. In order to get processed by the backend, it must pass the below checks;\n\n1. The HTTP request must have valid body and headers according to [the reference](api-post-search)\n2. The JSON payload must contain a valid [rune](search-getting-started).\n3. The query cannot be in a 'deny list', which may be the result of it being too resource intensive.\n4. Rules & limits\n4.1 The rune is validated against a set of rules, which define what searches are supported\n4.2 The rune is validated against a set of limits on quantities derived from the rune itself, see [search request limits](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/validation/request-rules-and-limits/#search-request-limits)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_4e92caa88f22040a41e57c386381a1c2f048f5d022f38c27b99f19e0cefdb8d9_v2"}
