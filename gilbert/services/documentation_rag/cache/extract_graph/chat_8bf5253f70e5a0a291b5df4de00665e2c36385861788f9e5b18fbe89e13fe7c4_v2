Unfortunately,\nthere are also some more complex aliases that reside in [boolean-query-parser](https://github.com/meltwater/boolean-query-parser/blob/14997b5ab88ae8835315bc66b6391e807a7921cb/boolean-query-parser/src/main/kotlin/com/meltwater/booleanqueryparser/BooleanQueryParser.kt#L173).\n\n**NOTE**:The aliases are only valid to use in *boolean queries* and **must** be expanded before they get converted to a rune format.\n\nE.g. the alias `content` for `body.content.text`\n```yaml\n  body.content.text:\n    type: string\n    indexed: true\n    analyzed: true\n    reversed: true\n    prefixes: true\n    aliases:\n      - content\n```\n\nOne field can have multiple aliases, e.g. the field `metaData.authors.authorInfo.handle` is aliased by `author`, `from` and `handle`.\n\n```yaml\n    metaData.authors.authorInfo.handle:\n      type: string\n      indexed: true\n      reversed: true\n      aliases:\n        - author\n        - from\n        - handle\n```\n\nNote that the same alias can point to more than one field, thus indicating that a consumer who is using such an alias\nis actually interested in all of those fields. E.g. the alias author points to both `metaData.authors.authorInfo.handle` and\n`metaData.authors.authorInfo.rawName`\n\n```yaml\n    metaData.authors.authorInfo.handle:\n      type: string\n      indexed: true\n      reversed: true\n      aliases:\n        - author\n        - from\n        - handle\n    metaData.authors.authorInfo.rawName:\n      type: string\n      indexed: true\n      analyzed: true\n      reversed: true\n      aliases:\n        - author\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8bf5253f70e5a0a291b5df4de00665e2c36385861788f9e5b18fbe89e13fe7c4_v2"}
