This enables queries to be built using MI [Saved Searches](/docs/default/API/masfsearch-v3). It works with both regular and explore searches.\n\nA saved search can be included in the query by add including a query type `savedSearch` and the `searchId`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"savedSearch\",\n    \"searchId\" : 12345\n}\n```\nBefore the search query is executed, this `savedSearch` query is replaced by the runes for the saved search in question.\n\n*Note: the company specified by the `modifiers.requestorCompanyId` must have access to the `searchId` specified or a `404` response will be returned.*\n\nBelow are a some examples on how you can build queries using saved searches.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Using the savedSearch query type\n\nThis example illustrates using a saved search to select content within a date range.\n\n#####
