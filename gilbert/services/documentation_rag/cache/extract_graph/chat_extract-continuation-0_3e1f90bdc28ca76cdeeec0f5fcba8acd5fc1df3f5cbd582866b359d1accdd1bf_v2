Formulating a Boolean query\n\nQueries use something called the *Runes* query syntax, which takes the form of a tree of JSON objects with multiple nesting levels. It has a number of query constructs and allows expressing complicated Boolean logic.\n\nThe [Queries](queries/index.md) page contains a full specification of the Runes query types.\n\n### 3. k-nearest neighbor search\n\nIn order to do k-NN search, the following parameters have to be provided as part of the `knn` section:\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **k**: The number of nearest neighbors to find.\n- **field**: The document field containing an embedding.\n- **vector**: The embedding for which you want to find documents with similar embeddings. The type is a float array, where the number of dimensions must align with the field. In order to generate a query vector/embedding, you need to use the same embedding model as when indexing. You should use [`clippy-api-embedding`](/catalog/default/api/linkfluence-clippy-api-embedding/definition) when querying `enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.vector`.\n- **filter**: A rune limiting the search space, see [Queries](queries/index.md) for more information.\n\nNote 1: Support for k-NN search is currently experimental.\n\nNote 2: The only view requests applicable to k-NN search are the result list and the sorted result list. See [Results#Retrieving Hits](results/retrieving-hits.md) for more information.\n\n### 4. Analytics aggregations\n\nThere's many aggregations for different types of analytics, statistics, faceting and histograms. Many of the aggregations can be nested within each other, for example to calculate aggregate statistics for each day.\n\nA single [Search API](api-post-search.md) request would typically contain all the view requests that needs to be executed for the query. It's more cost effective to execute several aggregations in one go, compared to sending separate requests for each aggregation which is much more expensive.\n\nThe [Analytics](analytics/index.md) page contains a full specification of the available analytics aggregations.\n\n### 5. Result lists\nResult lists retrieve a sample of matching documents from the query. There's support for many typical features like pagination, sorting, relevancy ranking, match sentence extraction, similarity clustering and de-duplication.\n\nThe [Results](results/index.md) page contains a full specification of the available result lists.\n\n### 6. Validation\n\nAll requests sent to the Search API are always validated, and if an error occurs you'll receive an [error code](validation/error-codes.md) in the response payload. You can also explicitly ask for a validation through the [/search/validate endpoint](api-post-search-validate.md) and receive warnings and detailed explanations of potential problems. See [Validation](validation/index.md) for more details.\n\n### 7. Search Load\n\nInformation about the cluster load generated by a search can be found in [Kibana](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/83aaf6d4a0328ca70b662fa1f301e8b2)\nReplace \"123*\"  with the trace_id that you want to trace.\n**msg_totalEsProcessingTime**: the total time taken in CPU milliseconds of the search in the ES cluster\n**msg_serviceTime**: the wall clock time of the search\n**msg_totalHits**: the number of documents matched by the search\n\nSome related dashboards:\n[IR Cluster Load Breakdown](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/c9640141d3c9045695a62da23834513e)\n[Search Transparency](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/066e614e1bb5aa04c391051729075dbd)\n\n### 8. Troubleshooting\n\nIt's recommended to provide a **traceId** query param with a unique id identifying your request. That way, if you have a failing search request, error logs can be found at https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/9786f20a92c5913458d163dd82efba4e. Replace\n\"123*\"  with the traceId.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RUNES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Runes is a query syntax used for formulating complex Boolean logic in JSON format for search queries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIBANA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool used for monitoring and analyzing search cluster load and performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELTWATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meltwater is a company providing media monitoring and social media analytics, which hosts the Kibana dashboards mentioned)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUNES<|>KIBANA<|>Runes query syntax is used in search queries whose performance and load can be monitored using Kibana<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIBANA<|>MELTWATER<|>Kibana is used by Meltwater for monitoring search cluster load and performance<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
