utilize vector search functionality which builds upon the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search features available in V1. Similar to regular query requests, users can access legally compliant search content along with the various enhancements offered by V2.\n\n### Knn Request using Vector\n\nTo construct a V2 kNN request, please provide modifiers (in the same way you would for regular searches) on top of [V1 kNN request](/docs/default/api/search-api-v1/#3-k-nearest-neighbor-search). For detailed information on all modifier parameters, refer to the [Request Modifiers](v2-request-modifiers.md) page. \n\nWhen retrieving results, only the `resultList` is supported, and you can check [this page](/docs/default/api/search-api-v1/results/retrieving-hits/#result-list) for the specific fields you can request.\n\nExample request:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"knn\": {\n    \"k\": 10,\n    \"field\": \"enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.vector\",\n    \"vector\": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], \n    \"filter\": {\n      \"type\": \"all\",\n      \"allQueries\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"term\",\n          \"field\": \"metaData.provider.type\",\n          \"value\": \"mw\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"range\",\n          \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n          \"from\": 1729382400000,\n          \"to\": 1729468800000\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"modifiers\": {\n    \"productType\": \"swagger\",\n    \"requestorCompanyId\": \"59103b0662eb71f944d99b05\",\n    \"requestorUserId\": \"59103b0762eb71f944d99b06\"\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"hits\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n``` \n\n### kNN Request using query string \n\nSearch V2 can translate a query string into vector. This enables you to pass a text field (which we will the convert to a vector) instead of a vector array as part of the knn query. Instead of manually providing a vector array, you can simply set the `text` field, and Search V2 will automatically populate the vector array for you.\n\nExample request:\n\n``` json\n{\n    \"knn\": {\n      \"k\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Did Microsoft make a good deal when investing in OpenAI?\",\n      \"field\": \"enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.vector\",\n      \"filter\": {\n        \"allQueries\": [\n          {\n            \"field\": \"body.content.text\",\n            \"type\": \"word\",\n            \"value\": \"microsoft\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"type\": \"all\"\n      }\n    }\n...\n}\n``` \n\n## Sample Search\nThe Search API V2 now supports Sample search. The new `/search/sample` endpoint is a wrapper around the `/search/sample` [endpoint of Search API V1](/docs/default/api/search-api-v1/api-post-search-sample). This endpoint is designed for fetching fast, but approximate search results. It consumes significantly (40%-60%) fewer resources on Horace's side.\nBecause of this, there are some limitations on the search criteria. These limits are controlled by the V1 API. The request and response formats for this endpoint are identical to that of the `/search` endpoint. For more information, please read the linked documentation of V1 API above.\n\n\n## Explore+ Search\n\nThis feature allows clients to perform searches in Explore+, with queries and view requests similar to `/v2/search`\nby calling the end-point `/v2/search/explore-plus`.\n\nSee Example Request below for an example of how a request can look. Responses are identical to `/v2/search` responses.\n\n**N.B.** Due to being in active development, this end-point is currently only available to white-listed product\ntypes.
