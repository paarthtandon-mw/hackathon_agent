Specific parts of runes queries can be annotated with a `queryTag` object to identify, and optionally match documents against that part of the query.\n\n**What are QueryTags for?**\n\nQuery tags were primarily built to support Explore custom categories, but can be used to define some structure to the runes query. For example, when an explore saved search is converted into runes, the resulting query is one large JSON object, with no way to determine what part of the query was for explore filters, custom categories or the base query itself. `queryTags` can be used to annotate the different parts of the runes query to help consumers of runes queries to resolve the query into it's different parts.\n\n**How does \"matching\" work?**\n\nWhen `includeMatch` is set to `true`, the Search/Export V2 API will post-process documents in result lists, to determine what queryTags they matched with. This can be helpful to know why the document was included in the result list. For example, if a user creates an explore search with three custom categories, the documents in the result list will include the queryTag for the custom category they are associated with.\n\n**`queryTag` schema**\n\nQuery tags have the following fields:\n\n* **id (required):** an identifier for the query tag\n* **type (required):** the type of query tag. E.g 'customCategory'\n* **includeMatch (required):** Defaults to `false`. A boolean value that determines whether result list documents will be \"matched\" against the queryTag.\n* **additionalAttributes (optional):** A JSON object that will be included with any documents that match the queryTag.\n\n***(`id`, `type`) constraint***\n\nThe tuple (`id` and `type`) is expected to uniquely correspond to one sub-query. If a query tag occurs at several places\nin the request, the Search API v2 assumes that their sub-queries are identical.\n\n**Example**\n\nHere's a sample request for the word `platypus`, but with a custom category queryTag for `car`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"type\": \"all\",\n    \"allQueries\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"word\",\n        \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n        \"value\": \"tesla\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"range\",\n        \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"from\": \"2020-08-11T20:13:30.000Z\",\n        \"to\": \"2020-08-13T20:13:30.000Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"any\",\n        \"anyQueries\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"car\",\n            \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n            \"type\": \"word\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"car\",\n            \"field\": \"body.ingress.text\",\n            \"type\": \"word\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"car\",\n            \"field\": \"body.content.text\",\n            \"type\": \"word\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"value\": \"car\",\n            \"field\": \"body.contentTags\",\n            \"type\": \"term\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"queryTag\": {\n          \"type\": \"customCategory\",\n          \"id\": \"1073\",\n          \"includeMatch\": true,\n          \"additionalAttributes\": {\n            \"name\": \"car\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"searchResults\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\",\n      \"start\": 0,\n      \"size\": 10,\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"body.title.text\",\n        \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"metaData.url\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"modifiers\": {\n    \"requestorCompanyId\": \"59103b0662eb71f944d99b05\",\n    \"requestorUserId\": \"59103b0762eb71f944d99b06\",\n    \"productType\": \"swagger\"\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n\nAnd here's what the `resultList` the response might look like. The `matchQueryTag` attributes will be a list of the query tags that the document matched:\n\n\n```json\n{\n    \"resultList\": {\n        \"results\": [\n            {\n                \"quiddity\": {\n                  \"id\": \"someDocumentId\"\n                },\n                \"highlights\": {...},\n                \"consumerAttributes\": {\n                    \"embedUrl\": \"https://emded-url-paywall.com/redirect\",\n                    \"paywallUrl\": \"https://paywall-url.com/redirect\",\n                    \"matchSentence\": \"this is a match sentence\",\n                    \"disableInAppOpening\": true,\n                    \"isInternalSharingDisabled\": false,\n                    \"isSharingDisabled\": false,\n                    \"isTranslateDisabled\": true,\n                    \"originalUrl\": \"https://example.com\",\n                    \"redirectUrl\": \"https://example.com\",\n                    \"restrictionHistory\": [],\n                    \"tagContextMatchSentence\":\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Search API V2 is a service that allows for querying and retrieving documents with specific criteria, including the use of query tags for categorization and matching)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUERY TAG<|>EVENT<|>Query tags are used in the Search API V2 to annotate and match documents against specific parts of a query, helping to identify why a document was included in the result list)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPLORE CUSTOM CATEGORIES<|>EVENT<|>Explore custom categories are a feature supported by query tags in the Search API V2, allowing for the categorization of documents based on specific criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUNES QUERY<|>EVENT<|>A runes query is a JSON object used in the Search API V2 to define search criteria, which can be annotated with query tags for better structure and categorization)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>QUERY TAG<|>Query tags are a feature of the Search API V2 used to annotate and match documents<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>EXPLORE CUSTOM CATEGORIES<|>Explore custom categories are supported by the Search API V2 through the use of query tags<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEARCH API V2<|>RUNES QUERY<|>Runes queries are used in the Search API V2 to define search criteria<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERY TAG<|>EXPLORE CUSTOM CATEGORIES<|>Query tags are used to support explore custom categories by categorizing documents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUERY TAG<|>RUNES QUERY<|>Query tags are used to annotate runes queries for better structure and categorization<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
