The large the number the better aggregate data, but the slower the request.\n* **minFollowers** *(optional, default 50)*: represents the minimum number of followers a twitter author should have to be included. Recommended minimum value is 50.\n\n## How it works\nWhen using the `audienceAggregate` view request, the search request will be enhanced with an extra view request to retrieve (up to [`size`]) twitter authors having a follower count of at least 50. Before returning the search results, the list of authors will be sent to Linkfluence to build aggregate data which will then be included in the response.\n\n## Sample Request\n\n```json\n{\n
