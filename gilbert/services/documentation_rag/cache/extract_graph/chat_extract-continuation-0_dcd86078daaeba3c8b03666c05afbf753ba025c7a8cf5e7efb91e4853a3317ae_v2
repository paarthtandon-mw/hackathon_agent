Non-analyzed fields are categorical fields where exact matching is supported, for example language and country codes.\n- **terms** query which filters for an multiple values in a field, for non-analyzed fields. Non-analyzed fields are categorical fields where exact matching is supported, for example language and country codes.\n- **word** query which performs full text search of analyzed fields. Analyzed fields are those where keyword/phrase based search are supported, for example the document title and body.\n- **wildcard** query allows for expansion of \\* and ? wildcards in words.\n- **range** query matches a numeric or date field with an upper and lower bounds.\n- **exists** query which filters for an existing field.\n\n**Boolean queries**:\n\n- **all** query represent an *AND* statement.
