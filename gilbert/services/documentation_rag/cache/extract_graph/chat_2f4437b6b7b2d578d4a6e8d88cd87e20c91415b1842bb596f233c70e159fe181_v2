You can always and quickly get advice and architecture review from @horace in #horace, we're here to help!\"\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe Search API allows you to execute Boolean queries against all the Meltwater content and retrieve aggregated analytics and result lists. It's a low-latency synchronous API where you execute requests and receive analytics and matches.\n\n\n### 1. The anatomy of search requests\n\nA search request consists of a Boolean query **or** a k-NN configuration, and a number of different view requests to execute over the matched documents.\n\nThe search query parameter express the Boolean conditions that documents must match, for example the search terms to find. It must contain a time range filter that restricts the publish time of documents to match.\n\nThe k-NN parameter controls how to do k-nearest neighbor search. It includes which embedding field to match, the query embedding itself and a Boolean query limiting the result set.\n\nThe view requests express one or more aggregations and result lists that should be calculated from the matched documents. View requests are typically a mix of multiple aggregations, nested aggregations and result lists.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **query** (*required unless `knn` is set*): The filter to match documents against, see [Queries](queries/index.md) and [Fields](https://backstage.meltwater.io/docs/default/Component/mi-information-model/dataset/fields/document/).\n- **knn** (*required unless `query` is set*): Configuration for k-nearest neighbor search.\n- **viewRequests**: The aggregations and result lists to calculate, see e.g. [Analytics#Faceting](analytics/faceting.md) and [Results#Clustering](results/clustering.md).\n- **overlayGroups** (*optional*): List of namespaces to include customer private documents and modifications from, see [Overlays](advanced-usage/overlays.md)\n- **scope** (*optional*): Scope allows searching on specific document states, see [Overlays](advanced-usage/overlays.md).\n- **restrictions** (*optional*): Restrictions is used to determine what results are legal to show to the requestor, see [Restrictions](validation/restrictions.md). If not specified, all results with any restriction will be omitted. **Note**: Not all kind of restrictions are applied via the search API.\n- **metaData** (*optional*): MetaData is used for tracking information about the origin of a search request. Although optional, we highly recommend setting it to enable us to quickly identify the source of problematic requests. Partial metadata, e.g. only productType and companyId is also accepted.\n\nExample: Searching for \"meltwater\" in the document title and executing 2 views (count total matches; and retrieve sample of search results)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"type\": \"all\",\n    \"allQueries\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"word\",\n        \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n        \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"range\",\n        \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"from\": 1546300800000,\n        \"to\": 1546905599999\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"documentCount\": {\n      \"type\": \"count\"\n    },\n    \"searchResults\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\",\n      \"start\": 0,\n      \"size\": 2,\n      \"fields\": [\n        \"body.title.text\",\n        \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"metaData.url\"\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"restrictions\": {\n    \"requestorCountry\": \"se\"\n  },\n  \"metaData\": {\n    \"userId\": \"my-user\",\n    \"companyId\": \"5e00abcd1234efgh5678\",\n    \"savedSearchIds\": [\n      \"123456\",\n      \"7891011\"\n    ],\n    \"productType\": \"Explore\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample: k-nearest neighbor search (remember to replace `vector` with a float array of the correct length)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"knn\": {\n    \"k\": 10,\n    \"field\": \"enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.vector\",\n    \"vector\": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], // Replace this float array with a high-dimensional vector of the correct length.\n    \"filter\": {\n      \"type\": \"all\",\n      \"allQueries\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"term\",\n          \"field\": \"metaData.provider.type\",\n          \"value\": \"mw\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"range\",\n          \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n          \"from\": 1729382400000,\n          \"to\": 1729468800000\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"hits\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\",\n      \"nestedFieldOptions\": {\n        \"enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks\": {\n          \"fields\": [\"enrichments.embeddings.clippyV1.contentChunks.text\"],\n          \"size\":\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2f4437b6b7b2d578d4a6e8d88cd87e20c91415b1842bb596f233c70e159fe181_v2"}
