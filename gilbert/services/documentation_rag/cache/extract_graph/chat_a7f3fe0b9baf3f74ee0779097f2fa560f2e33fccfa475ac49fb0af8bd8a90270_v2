Some fields in the gyda format are directly mapped from the fields on the General tenant schema, whereas some fields are computed in the contextual layer. The computed\nfields may make use of some fields on the General tenant schema or may be entirely created based on the consumer specific information such as the company, entitlement, user etc.\n\n## Fields mapped to General tenant schema fields\n\nThe following fields are mapped to one or more fields on the General tenant schema or search response highlights. \n\nIn some cases, additional logic decides which quiddity fields should be used for mapping. This logic is usually source/document-type specific. For example, for Twitter, the `title` value is usually mapped from `body.title.text`, but for some social content like Reddit, the value is mapped from `metaData.thread.title`.\n\n| Field                    | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| documentId               | string                      | The unique identified of the document                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| externalId               | string                      | A unique external identifier of the document in an URN format.
