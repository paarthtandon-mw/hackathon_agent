Boolean Query type\n\nThe Search API V2 adds a new `boolean` query type.\n\nA boolean can be included in the query by adding a boolean query type\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"boolean\",\n  \"booleanQuery\": \"hello AND title:world\",\n  \"caseSensitive\": \"no\"\n}\n```\nThe `boolean` query is substituted with the corresponding runes before executing the search query.\n\n#### Example: Using a boolean query type\n\n##### Request\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"type\": \"all\",\n        \"allQueries\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"boolean\",\n                \"booleanQuery\": \"\\\"Platypus\\\" AND \\\"wild\\\"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"range\",\n                \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n                \"from\": \"2023-12-01T23:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"to\": \"2023-12-07T23:00:00.000Z\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"viewRequests\": {\n        \"documentCount\": {\n            \"type\": \"count\"\n        },\n        \"list\": {\n            \"type\": \"resultList\",\n            \"fields\": [\n                \"body.content.text\"\n            ],\n            \"size\": 10,\n            \"start\": 0\n        }\n    },\n    \"modifiers\": {\n        \"requestorCompanyId\": \"59103b0662eb71f944d99b05\",\n        \"requestorUserId\": \"59103b0762eb71f944d99b06\",\n        \"productType\": \"swagger\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### Boolean query containing special characters\n\nIf your boolean query contains special characters such as quotes, you need to escape them as in the example provided below. For example, imagine you have created a tag called `\"My Tag With Quotes\"`.\nIf you want to execute a search for all documents tagged with this tag, the boolean query that you would use in the MI app looks like this\n\n```text\nmetaData.userTags:\"\\\"My Tag With Quotes\\\"\"\n```\n\nHowever, when sending this inside a search request, since the entire boolean query needs to be passed as a string, it gets surrounded with one more layer of quotes and therefore all the special characters enclosed in it, need to be escaped again.\nThis is what we expect the search request to look like\n\n```json\n{\n    \"query\": {\n        \"type\": \"all\",\n        \"allQueries\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"boolean\",\n                \"booleanQuery\": \"metaData.userTags:\\\"\\\\\\\"My Tag With Quotes\\\\\\\"\\\"\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"type\": \"range\",\n                \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n                \"from\": \"2023-12-01T23:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"to\": \"2023-12-07T23:00:00.000Z\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"viewRequests\": {\n        \"documentCount\": {\n            \"type\": \"count\"\n        },\n        \"list\": {\n            \"type\": \"resultList\",\n            \"fields\": [\n                \"body.content.text\"\n            ],\n            \"size\": 10,\n            \"start\": 0\n        }\n    },\n    \"modifiers\": {\n        \"requestorCompanyId\": \"59103b0662eb71f944d99b05\",\n        \"requestorUserId\": \"59103b0762eb71f944d99b06\",\n        \"productType\": \"swagger\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you use a javascript client, `JSON.stringify()` should handle this for you. Sample code\n\n```javascript\nconst booleanQueryValue = `metaData.userTags:\"\\\"My Tag With Quotes\\\"\"`;\n\nconst jsonPayload = JSON.stringify({\n    booleanQuery: booleanQueryValue\n});\n\nconsole.log(jsonPayload);\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f45a24e82eadff2e1d653f1a9cff4a1a25a8105c7ea0cf7797d2f9ca1aa7aef6_v2"}
