One example of that is if the top level entity Microsoft is mentioned in the document.\n\nIt is also possible that the top level entity is NOT present in the 'named entities' fields, for example if Sharepoint (which has Microsoft as its parent) is mentioned in the document, but the Microsoft entity is not mentioned by itself.\n\n#### Top-Level Entity semantics\nA top-level entity is an organization that (a) has at least one child (subsidiary, person, or product), AND (b) no parent organization (i.e., is not a subsidiary itself).\n\n#### Grouping semantics\n- Descendants are grouped to the top-most entity only, _not to the intermediate parent entities_\n- Child companies are linked to the top-most parent company if it is in a subsidiary relationship to any of the intermediary\ncompanies\n- Child persons are linked to the top-most parent company if it is an executive or board member of the intermediary\ncompanies\n- Child products are linked to the parent company if it is produced by any of the intermediary companies\n\n####  Sentiment aggregation semantics\n- The sentiment of the top-level entity is computed per document by aggregating all the child entities (present in the\n  document) sentiment polarities.\n    - Sentiment is propagated from descendants to top-level entities (no weights are applied to distinguish generations)\n    - At most one sentiment per top-level entity per document\n- A top-level entity is created when any of its descendant entities are detected, even **when the top-level entity is not\nexplicitly mentioned in the article**\n  - NB: In the case entities that belong to multiple top-level entities (e.g. Elon Musk -> Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company\n  etc), all the top-level entities will be shown in the dropdown but this is deemed acceptable as only 4% of persons in\n  the KG are associated with multiple companies.\n\n### Value uniqueness constraint\nNote that we only allow one entry of a given KG id in one of the four `topLevelEntitySentiment` fields. \nOr in other words, it is NOT allowed for Google (id = gog-415) to be present in both\n`enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.p` and `enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.v`, only one of the field is chosen at index time.\n\n| Field Name                            | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Filter Type | Field Type    | Owner |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ----------- | ------------- |-------|\n| enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.p | This field contians a (possibly empty) list of KG entity ids of the top level entites that are determined to be talked about in a **positive way** in the document | Exact match | String        | Karma |\n| enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.n | This field contians a (possibly empty) list of KG entity ids of the top level entites that are determined to be talked about in a **neutral way** in the document  | Exact match | String        | Karma |\n| enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.v | This field contians a (possibly empty) list of KG entity ids of the top level entites that are determined to be talked about in a **negative way** in the document | Exact match | String        | Karma |\n| enrichments.topLevelEntitySentiment.u | This field contians a (possibly empty) list of KG entity ids where the sentiment towards the top level entity **can not be determined**                            | Exact match | String        | Karma |\n\n## Topics\n\nText classification and categorization.\n\n| Field Name                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     | Filter Type | Field Type                                                                                                                   | Owner       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| enrichments.categories.label<br><br>**category**       | Wikipedia category classification on the document text.
