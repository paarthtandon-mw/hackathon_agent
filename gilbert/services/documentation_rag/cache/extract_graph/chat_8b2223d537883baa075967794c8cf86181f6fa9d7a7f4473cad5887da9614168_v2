However, when `savedSearch` queries are used in combination with additional runes queries, twitter guardrails handling becomes more complex. Twitter guardrails are in place to prevent public companies from targeting individual users. We've put logic in place to try to ensure users don't bypass these restrictions by combining `savedSearch` queries with unapproved runes.\n\nThe following points clarify how the logic works in more complex cases:\n\n* If the query contains a `savedSearch` query AND a query of type  [`term`](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/field-queries/#term-query), [`word`](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/field-queries/#word-query), or [`wildcard`](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/field-queries/#wildcard-query), then approval is `false` regardless of `twitterApproved` state of saved search\n\n* If a `savedSearch` is part of the `notMatchQuery` part of a [`not query`](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/boolean-queries/#not-query), then approval is `false` regardless of `twitterApproved` state of saved search\n\n* If there is a single `savedSearch` query in the request, the Search API V2 uses the approved value of that saved search.\n\n* If there are multiple `savedSearch` queries in a request, the Search API V2 applies the `AND` operator between the approved values of those saved searches, i.e. final value can be `true` if and only if all searches have `twitterApproved: true`.\n\n* [`modifiers.twitterApproved`](v2-request-modifiers.md#modifiers-parameters-in-detail) **overrides** the result of the logic explained above. If you would still need to set `modifiers.twitterApproved` along with the savedSearch(es) in query, **please reach out** to our [Slack channel](https://meltwater.slack.com/archives/CAJKZ9RDE) to discuss your use case.\n\nFor a clearer visualization, you can take a look at the flow chart diagram from [here](https://github.com/meltwater/gandalf/blob/5747cb2d015fad7a8ec546211ef30981aa55c2d2/docs/adr/0003-twitter-approval-logic.md)\n\n\n## Search Information Types\n\n**Standard (legacy) Searches**\nStandard (legacy) MI searches have a specific information type i.e. \"news\", \"social\" or \"broadcast\". When building runes for these searches, the Search API V2 respects these information types,\n\n**Explore Searches**\nFor backwards compatibility with some legacy components, explore searches are also saved with a specific information type. As with the Explore product itself, the Search API V2 does not use these information types when building runes with explore searches. For example, if you have an explore search that is saved as 'Social' search, you may still receive editorial or broadcast results when using the `savedSearch` query type.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_8b2223d537883baa075967794c8cf86181f6fa9d7a7f4473cad5887da9614168_v2"}
