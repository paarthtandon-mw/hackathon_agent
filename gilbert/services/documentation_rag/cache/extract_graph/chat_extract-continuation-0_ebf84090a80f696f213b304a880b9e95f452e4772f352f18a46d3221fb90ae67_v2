All valid Unicode emojis should be supported. \n\nThe emojis are subject to some normalization to make searches and analysis easier. Here is a list of noteworthy quirks:\n\n1. Skin colors are ignored in document ingestion, which has the following implications:\n\n- You can not search for e.g. a dark skinned smiley. You can only search for a smiley and it will return all documents regardless of skin color.\n- If you do a terms facet, which can be used for word clouds, emojis of all skin colors will be displayed as an emoji without skin color.\n\n2.
