To keep a clear distinction between this extra data and the document data in Elasticsearch, it's wrapped in a `consumerAttributes` object as part of with each document in a resultList.\n\nFor example, a `resultList` of documents will be in the format:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"quiddity\": { ... },\n    \"highlights\": { ... },\n    \"consumerAttributes\": {...}\n  },\n  {\n    \"quiddity\": { ... },\n    \"highlights\": { ... },\n    \"consumerAttributes\": {...}\n  }\n]                  \n```\n\n## Sample `consumerAttributes`\n\nThe following gives an example of what a populated `consumerAttributes` object looks like.
