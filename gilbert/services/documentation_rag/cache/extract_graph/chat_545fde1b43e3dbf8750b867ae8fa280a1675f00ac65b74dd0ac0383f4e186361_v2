Currently, the only valid flag is EXACT_CASE. Applying this flag forces the search engine to be case sensitive when matching.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n**Example**\n```json\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"wildcard\",\n  \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n  \"value\": \"meltwater?\"\n}\n\n// Match for a phrase in the document title with an optional suffix, for example matching words \"monitor\", \"monitors\" and \"monitoring\".\n{\n  \"type\": \"wildcard\",\n  \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n  \"value\": \"meltwater media monitor*\"\n}\n\n// Match Katakana text in the document title with an optional suffix, for example matching words \"オリンピック\" and \"オリンピックオ\".\n{\n  \"type\": \"wildcard\",\n  \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n  \"value\": \"オリンピック*\"\n}\n\n// Useless wildcard to match CJK (non Katakana) text in the document title containing \"天然水\". This gives the same results as without the wildcard.\n{\n  \"type\": \"wildcard\",\n  \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n  \"value\": \"天然水*\"\n}\n```\n\n## Range Query\n\nMatches values within a specified range in a numeric or date field. \n\nDate fields are stored in milliseconds since the start of 1970 and are always in UTC. This means that if your users expect dates to be split by their time zone, you need to convert that date into UTC. For convenience, dates can also be expressed in ISO8601 format, e.g. \"2015-08-25T13:23:10.69Z\" instead of 1440508990690. \n\nWhen performing date queries both upper and lower bounds must be specified. When performing range queries on other numeric fields you can optionally specify only one of the bounds.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **field**: The field to filter on.\n- **from**: The lower bound.\n- **to**: The upper bound.\n- **includeFrom** (default *true*): If the *from* value should be included in the range.\n- **includeTo** (default *false*): If the 'to' value should be included in the range.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n```json\n// Restrict the time range of the query\n{\n  \"type\": \"range\",\n  \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n  \"from\": 1548248713000,\n  \"to\": 1548853515000\n}\n\n// Find articles that've gone viral on Twitter\n{\n  \"type\": \"range\",\n  \"field\": \"metaData.socialScores.tw_shares\",\n  \"from\": 10000\n}\n```\n\n## Exists Query\n\nMatches when a document contains an indexed value for a field. That is, matches if the value is _not_ null and _not_ ´[]´.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **field**: The field to search in.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"exists\",\n  \"field\": \"metaData.applicationTags\"\n}\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_545fde1b43e3dbf8750b867ae8fa280a1675f00ac65b74dd0ac0383f4e186361_v2"}
