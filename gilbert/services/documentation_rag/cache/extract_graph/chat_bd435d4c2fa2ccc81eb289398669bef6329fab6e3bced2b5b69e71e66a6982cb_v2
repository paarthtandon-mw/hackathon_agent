Formulating a Boolean query\n\nQueries use something called the *Runes* query syntax, which takes the form of a tree of JSON objects with multiple nesting levels. It has a number of query constructs and allows expressing complicated Boolean logic.\n\nThe [Queries](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/queries/) page contains a full specification of the Runes query types.\n\n## 3. Analytics aggregations\n\nThere's many aggregations for different types of analytics, statistics, faceting and histograms. Many of the aggregations can be nested within each other, for example to calculate aggregate statistics for each day.\n\nA single [Search API](/catalog/default/api/search-api-v2/definition#/default/v2-api-post-search) request would typically contain all the view requests that needs to be executed for the query. It's more cost effective to execute several aggregations in one go, compared to sending separate requests for each aggregation which is much more expensive.\n\nThe [Analytics](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/analytics/statistics/) page contains a full specification of the available analytics aggregations.\n\nFor contractual reasons, aggregations from Search v2 do not include numbers from YouTube.\n\n## 4. Result lists\n\nResult lists retrieve a sample of matching documents from the query. There's support for many typical features like pagination, sorting, relevancy ranking, match sentence extraction, similarity clustering and de-duplication.\n\nThe [Results](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/results/retrieving-hits/) page contains a full specification of the available result lists.\n\nThe [Response Consumer Attributes](v2-consumer-attributes.md) page contains details of the enhanced response data provided by the Search API V2.\n\n## 5. Validation\n\nAll requests sent to the Search API are always validated, and if an error occurs you'll receive an [error code](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/validation/error-codes/) in the response payload. You can also explicitly ask for a validation through the [/search/validate endpoint](/catalog/default/api/search-api-v2/definition#/default/v2-api-post-search-validate) and receive warnings and detailed explanations of potential problems. See [Validation](/docs/default/API/search-api-v1/validation/) for more details.\n\n## 6. Search Load\n\nInformation about the cluster load generated by a search can be found in [Kibana](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/83aaf6d4a0328ca70b662fa1f301e8b2)\nReplace \"123*\"  with the trace_id that you want to trace.\n**msg_totalEsProcessingTime**: the total time taken in CPU milliseconds of the search in the ES cluster\n**msg_serviceTime**: the wall clock time of the search\n**msg_totalHits**: the number of documents matched by the search\n\nSome related dashboards:\n[IR Cluster Load Breakdown](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/c9640141d3c9045695a62da23834513e)\n[Search Transparency](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/066e614e1bb5aa04c391051729075dbd)\n\n## 7. Troubleshooting\n\nIt's recommended to provide a **traceId** query param with a unique id identifying your request. That way, if you have a failing search request, error logs can be found in [Kibana](https://kibana-prod.meltwater.io/goto/9786f20a92c5913458d163dd82efba4e). Replace\n\"123*\"  with the traceId.\n\n## 8. Error Responses\n\nWhere possible, the Search API V2 passes on errors from upstream services and with an identifier helping consumers find the source of the problem.\n\nSome sample error responses:\n\n=== \"JSON\"\n    ```json\n        {\n            \"error\": {\n                \"code\": 404,\n                \"message\": \"Entitlements for company not found\"\n            },\n            \"errorSource\": \"NODE_ENTITLEMENT_API\"\n        }\n    ``` \n=== \"Search API V2 validation error\"\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"error\": {\n            \"code\": 400,\n            \"message\": \"Both overlayGroups and requestorCompanyId cannot exist!\",\n            \"errors\": [\n                {\n                    \"reason\": \"Both overlayGroups and requestorCompanyId cannot exist!\",\n                    \"where\": \"searchRequest\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"errorSource\": \"SEARCH_API_V2\"\n    }\n    ```\n\nThe `errorSource` identifies the service returning the error. Some possible sources may be:\n\n* `SEARCH_API` - an error may have occurred validating or executing the search query\n* `NODE_COMPANY_API` - an error may have retrieving the company details for the ` \"requestorCompanyId\"`\n* `NODE_ENTITLEMENT_API` - an error may have retrieving the entitlements for the ` \"requestorCompanyId\"`\n* `SEARCH_API_V2` - an error may have processing the request or response\n* `RESTRICTION_API` - an error may have occurred while applying legal restrictions to the search results\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_bd435d4c2fa2ccc81eb289398669bef6329fab6e3bced2b5b69e71e66a6982cb_v2"}
