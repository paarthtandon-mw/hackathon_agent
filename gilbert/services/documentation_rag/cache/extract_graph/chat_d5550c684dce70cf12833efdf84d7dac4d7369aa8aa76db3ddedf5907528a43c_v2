It can be thought of as the Boolean *AND* operator.\nThe *all* query represent an *AND* statement. It requires all the nested conditions to match. If **allQueries** is an empty list, no filter is applied, i.e., all documents match.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **allQueries**: The nested queries which must all match.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n**Example**, find documents that mention a \"meltwater\" in the title, and within a certain time range\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"all\",\n  \"allQueries\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"word\",\n      \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n      \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"range\",\n      \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n      \"from\": 1548248713000,\n      \"to\": 1548853515000\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Any Query\n\nThe *any* query requires at least one of the nested queries to match. It can be thought of as the Boolean *OR* operator. If **anyQueries** is an empty list, no filter is applied, i.e., all documents match.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **anyQueries**: The nested queries of which at least one must match.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n**Example**, find documents that mention a \"meltwater\" in the title, ingress or body\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"any\",\n  \"anyQueries\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"word\",\n      \"field\": \"body.title.text\",\n      \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"word\",\n      \"field\": \"body.ingress.text\",\n      \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"word\",\n      \"field\": \"body.content.text\",\n      \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Not Query\n\nThe *not* query has one nested query that needs to match, and another nested query that must not match. It can be thought of as a Boolean *AND NOT* operator.\n\n**Note:** The reason why you can't make a 'not' query on its own is to prevent unbounded expensive searches.\n\n**Parameters**:\n\n- **matchQuery**: The nested query that must match.\n- **notMatchQuery**: The nested query that must not match.\n- **boost** (default *1.0*): Boost hits from this query compared to other queries, see [Sorting](../results/sorting.md).\n\n**Example**, find documents that mention \"meltwater\", but exclude documents about glaciers\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"not\",\n  \"matchQuery\": {\n    \"type\": \"word\",\n    \"field\": \"body.content.text\",\n    \"value\": \"meltwater\"\n  },\n  \"notMatchQuery\": {\n    \"type\": \"word\",\n    \"field\": \"body.content.text\",\n    \"value\": \"glacier\"\n  }\n}\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d5550c684dce70cf12833efdf84d7dac4d7369aa8aa76db3ddedf5907528a43c_v2"}
