If anything here seems useful to you, please let us know either through [our Slack channel](https://meltwater.slack.com/archives/CAJKZ9RDE), or [by sending us an email](mailto:platypus@meltwater.com).\n\n## Author Enrichments (Beta)\n\nThe Search API V2 (and Export API V2) now has Klear and Linkfluence author enrichments as an experimental feature. It can be enabled by setting the parameter `modifiers.enableAuthorEnrichments` to `true` and is applied to twitter results only.\n\nTo use this feature you'll also need to ensure that the view request fields includes `\"metaData.authors\"` and `\"metaData.source.socialOriginType\"`.\n\nWhen enabled, any twitter documents returned in a `resultList` will contain two new attributes in the per-document `consumerAttributes`.\n\n* `klearAuthors` will contain the author profile from Klear. An empty list will be returned if no information is found\n* `linkfluenceAuthors` will contain the author profile from Linkfluence. An empty list will be returned if no information is found\n\nThis is currently an experimental feature which **we do not advise using in a customer facing product in its current format**. We're providing the enrichments to help see what twitter author information is available from these integrations and how it might be used.\n\n**Note: **The response format *will* change and the `klearAuthors` and `linkfluenceAuthors` will be consolidated into a single authors object once a final schema has been agreed.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"resultList\": {\n        \"results\": [\n
