Channels can be any\n[`socialOriginType`](../source#social-origin-type), `editorial` or\n[`origin` for the virtual \"origin\" channel](#origin-fields).\n\nExamples of channels include [`editorial`](#editorial), [`twitter`](#xtwitter), and [`sina_weibo`](#sina-weibo).\n\n## Origin Fields\n\nThe metrics tree includes a \"virtual channel\", called `origin`, which contains the metrics from the channel the document originated.\nFor example, a X/Twitter tweet will contain:\n\n- `metrics.shares.origin.total`: Reposts and quotes of the tweet on X/Twitter.\n- `metrics.shares.origin.retweets`: Just the Reposts.\n- `metrics.shares.origin.quotes`: Just the Quote Tweets.\n\nAnd an Editorial document will contain:\n- `metrics.shares.origin.total`: Links to this document from other Editorial documents.\n- `metrics.shares.twitter.total`: Links to this document shared on X/Twitter, aka. \"Social Echo\".\n- `metrics.shares.reddit.total`: Links to this document shared on Reddit, aka. \"Social Echo\".\n- `metrics.shares.facebook.total`: Links to this document shared on Facebook, aka. \"Social Echo\".\n\nThis provides a common set of metrics that can be used in search queries to query across different channels.\n\nFor example, a query for `metrics.shares.origin.total > 0` will produce every document that has been shared at least once within the\nchannel it originated.\n\nIf you wish to search for documents only from a specific channel (e.g. \"X/Twitter\"), you should also include a predicate on the\n`socialOriginType`.\n\n### Summing metrics across all channels\n\nAll channel sums are represented in the field `metrics.*.total`. When summing shares of a document across _all channels_ `origin` represents the metrics of the origin platform and the named metrics (like metrics.shares.(twitter|facebook|reddit).total) represent shares in other platforms. \nEx.-1 when we count the total shares across all platforms for an editorial document:\n\n```\nmetrics.shares.total = metrics.shares.origin.total + metrics.shares.twitter.total + metrics.shares.facebook.total + metrics.shares.reddit.total\n```\nEx.-2 when we count the total shares accross all platforms for a twitter document (we only provide editorial shares of twitter documents so far)  :\n```\nmetrics.shares.total = metrics.shares.origin.total + metrics.shares.editorial.total\n```\n\n## Share Metrics\n\nShare metrics record the number of times a document was shared on a platform. The mechanism for sharing varies by\nplatform. Usually, documents shared within the same platform use a platform-specific sharing mechanism (e.g. Retweets,\non [X/Twitter](#xtwitter)), but documents shared _across_ platforms are shared by mention of their URL (e.g. sharing a\ntweet on [Reddit](#reddit)).\n\n## Conversation Metrics\n\nConversation metrics capture the number of documents that are comments on or replies to a document.\n\n!!! help \"Terminology\"\n\n    The terms used to describe conversation differs from platform-to-platform. The metrics are all under the `threads`\n    tree, but this term should _never_ be displayed to end-users.\n\n    Instead, the term should match what users would expect conversation to be labelled as on the platform it takes place\n    on, for example \"Replies\" on [X/Twitter](#xtwitter), and \"Comments\" on [Reddit](#reddit).\n\n    The field tables provide a recommended English language display name for each source.\n\nWe capture both linear conversations, where every comment is a direct reply to the top-level document, and threaded\nconversations, where comments can reply to other comments within the thread.\n\nComments/replies are counted [transitively](#transitive-replies) on all channels.\n\n!!! help \"<a id=\"transitive-replies\"></a>Transitive Replies\"\n\n    For threaded conversations, conversation metrics count every document that is _below_ the current document in the\n    thread.\n\n    This means that a parent post will count every reply, replies to replies, replies to replies to replies, etc.\n    Also, comments/replies in the thread will count every reply to that comment, as well as replies to replies, etc.\n\n    Comments/replies in a thread will _not_ count other comments/replies that are part of a different sub-thread.\n\n## Reaction Metrics\n\nReaction metrics capture engagement that doesn't provide any additional content (i.e.\n[conversation](#conversation-metrics)) or broadcast the document to a wider audience (i.e. [shares](#share-metrics)),\nsuch as \"likes\" and \"upvotes\".\n\nThe available reactions depend on the platform in question, only reactions supported by a platform will be available on\ndocuments from that platform. Where multiple platforms use the same (or similar) terminology _and semantics_ for a\nreaction, we have abstracted that reaction to a common name, e.g. both [Facebook](#facebook) and [X/Twitter](#xtwitter)\nhave `likes`, but only [Facebook](#facebook\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TALLY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tally is the owner of the fields in the document, as mentioned in the text<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELTWATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meltwater is the organization that monitors channels as sources of documents<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GYDA DOCUMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Gyda Documents refer to a type of documentation that applies to both the Information Model General Schema and Gyda documents<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>X/TWITTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>X/Twitter is a social media platform mentioned as a channel for document sharing and engagement<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REDDIT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Reddit is a social media platform mentioned as a channel for document sharing and engagement<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FACEBOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Facebook is a social media platform mentioned as a channel for document sharing and engagement<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TALLY<|>MELTWATER<|>Tally owns the fields in the document, which are monitored by Meltwater<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X/TWITTER<|>REDDIT<|>Both X/Twitter and Reddit are platforms where documents can be shared and engaged with<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>X/TWITTER<|>FACEBOOK<|>Both X/Twitter and Facebook are platforms where documents can be shared and engaged with<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REDDIT<|>FACEBOOK<|>Both Reddit and Facebook are platforms where documents can be shared and engaged with<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
