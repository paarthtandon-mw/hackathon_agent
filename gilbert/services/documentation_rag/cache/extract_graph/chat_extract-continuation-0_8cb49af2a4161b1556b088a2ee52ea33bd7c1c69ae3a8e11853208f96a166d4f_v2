links pointing to a share button\n- redirecting links\n\nWhen you process this data you also need to know that the links:\n\n- might contain some social media links\n- might refer to a URL shortener services\n- might point to tracker or aggregator sites\n\n### Normalized URLs\n\nSome fields contains normalized URLs. This makes it easier to search on them. Normalization does the following:\n\n1. Remove protocol (`http://` or `https://`)\n2. Add `www.` to the start of the URL if it does not point to a subdomain.\n\nBy removing the protocol there is no need to search for both http and https. In fact, if you include the protocol in your search you will not get any matches since the protocol is not stored.\n\nBy adding `www.` to URLs that are not subdomains you can search for articles on a website, but not from subdomains. Searching for `metaData.analyzedUrl:\"blogspot.com\"` would return articles from blogspot.com and articles from any subdomain of blogspot.com. If we only want articles from the main site we can search for `metaData.analyzedUrl:\"www.blogspot.com\"`.\n\n## Provider Specific\n\n| Field Name                                  | Description                                                                                         | Filter Type                 | Field Type  | Owner       |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| providerSpecific.description                | To be added                                                                                         | To be added                 | To be added | shakespeare |\n| providerSpecific.companyId                  | To be added                                                                                         | To be added                 | To be added | TBD         |\n| providerSpecific.docId                      | To be added                                                                                         | To be added                 | To be added | Shakespeare |\n| providerSpecific.docType                    | To be added                                                                                         | To be added                 | To be added | Shakespeare |\n| providerSpecific.duration                   | To be added                                                                                         | To be added                 | To be added | Shakespeare |\n| providerSpecific.facebookPostType           | Type of the facebook post.
