Responses are identical to `/v2/search` responses.\n\n**N.B.** Due to being in active development, this end-point is currently only available to white-listed product\ntypes. If you would like to use it, reach out in the [#platypus slack channel](https://meltwater.slack.com/archives/CAJKZ9RDE), or [by sending us an email](mailto:platypus@meltwater.com).\n\n### Differences from `/v2/search`\n\nResult grouping is not, and will likely not be, supported in Explore+ searches.\n\n### Current limitations\n\nThese features are currently not supported in Explore+ searches.\n\n#### Modifiers\n\nThe feature toggles in the `modifiers` object currently do not have any effect in this API. The values actually\nin use are the ones seen in the example request below.\n\nCurrently, only the Gyda document format is supported.\n\n#### consumerAttributes\n\nThe `consumerAttributes` object in the response search hits is mostly empty. For now, rely on the values in\nthe gyda document instead.\n\n#### No aggregations\n\nCurrently only document count and result list (but not grouped result list) view requests are supported.\n\n### Example request\n\n```json\n{\n  \"modifiers\": {\n    \"requestorCompanyId\": \"581c4c674582c828ac7ab902\",\n    \"requestorUserId\": \"581c4c674582c828ac7ab903\",\n    \"productType\": \"digest\",\n    \"documentFormat\": \"GYDA\",\n    \"enableLegalRestrictions\": true,\n    \"enablePaywall\": true,\n    \"enableMWTransitionTokens\": false,\n    \"enableAuthorEnrichments\": false,\n    \"enableGeonames\": true\n  },\n  \"query\": {\n    \"type\": \"all\",\n    \"allQueries\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"explorePlusSavedSearches\",\n        \"ids\": [5643]\n      },\n      {\n        \"field\": \"body.publishDate.date\",\n        \"from\": \"2024-12-01T00:15:15.000Z\",\n        \"to\": \"2024-12-01T01:15:15.000Z\",\n        \"type\": \"range\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"viewRequests\": {\n    \"count\": {\n      \"type\": \"count\"\n    },\n    \"searchResults\": {\n      \"type\": \"resultList\",\n      \"size\": 10,\n      \"start\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXPLORE+<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Explore+ is a feature that allows clients to perform searches with queries and view requests similar to /v2/search)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLATYPUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Platypus is a team or contact point at Meltwater for inquiries about the Explore+ feature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELTWATER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meltwater is the company developing the Explore+ feature and providing support through the Platypus team)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLORE+<|>PLATYPUS<|>Platypus is the contact point for inquiries about the Explore+ feature<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLORE+<|>MELTWATER<|>Meltwater is the company developing the Explore+ feature<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLATYPUS<|>MELTWATER<|>Platypus is a team or contact point within Meltwater<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
