# Information model guild

The Information Model Guild is a group of people from various part of the content stack.
This includes ingestion, storage, enrichment and client teams. While we currently have
no formal mission, we try to be a forum for attacking issues that span the whole stack
or that have no clear owner. We might not always be able to take decisions or answer
questions, but we know who you should talk to.

Discussions are usually handled in the [#ir-information-model](https://meltwater.slack.com/archives/C01MTH6QM55)
Slack channel. Feel free to tag @ir-information-guild. We also have a mailing list: information-model-guild@meltwater.com
